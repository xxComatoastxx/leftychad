Welp. it's another year. Another trip around the sun and I haven't learned much. Not much then the same shit I have known for the last 10 years. Namely, that capitalism is shit and makes us all social pariahs. That it is destroying the world and my beloved internet. None the less, happy late new years.

Well, the first thing that happened to me on news years was I lost my apartment. My bitch landlord decided that she wanted to evict me. She kept letting me stay after a few months of telling me she was gonna kick me out; Let me prempt this with I got a new job making bullets for the federal government. (I know it's a conudrum but I need the money) anyways. I had been working there for a few months and my schedual was pushed further back to where I was sleeping at 9:00m. Well after a few months I got a promotion there which ment I was having to wake up at 2:30 to walk to work. Long story short after allowing me to stay in the apartment on a prayer my landlords loud ass animals decide to start barking all night and day and keeping me up making it impossible to sleep.

So, I asked her very nicely, for weeks, to please quite the dogs down and she constantly ignored me.
She even went as far as to tell me to get my own "ear plugs" in my own fucking apartment. Well, after 4 weeks of asking her to quite her dogs down I finally threatend to file a complaint against her with the city. Well she decided to evict me in retaliation to that. Long story short: Yes it's very much illegal. Second, no I couldn't find a lawyer who would pick up the case. No they would not tell me why. Though I suspect that it had something to do with my finances because, you know, you can't get legal aid unless you ar rich in this country.

Anyways, so now I am staying at my sisters house sleeping on the couch in her basment, lol. (Double whammy) It's not that bad though. Her boyfriend plays music in a band so me and him jam and they have a little boy who is very sweet, but, his other uncle is a raging reactionary so I have to combat that cancerous ideology through science, reason, and materialism.

So, yeah, I lost my apartment, but, it isn't all that bad. After two years of living alone you kind of miss being part of a family unit.
So, it's not all bad in retrospect.

The only other bad news now is that I am sick. I have been sick for a few days. I have been waking up with a slight fever. I had to leave work tuesday because I woke up puking and had to go in to talk to my supervisor. I have been feeling so bad that I went and got tested for covid. I don't know if I have it or not. I personally think I do, but, better safe than sorry. And, I also can't go into work while I am waiting on my test results, so, i get some free time off! Normally that would matter, but, my sister isn't making me pay rent, so, it's not all that bad.

I don't have a fever right now and I didn't wake up puking, so, what ever it was might have passed. I have my vaccines, too. I need to get my boosters at this point in time, though.

Anyways, that's pretty much it. I'm couch surfing living in my sisters basment sick dying of covid, lol.

Happy new years.
